	<h2>What is web development ?</h2>
	<p>Web development refers to the process of building, creating, and maintaining websites or web applications. It encompasses a range of tasks, including web design, content creation, server-side scripting, client-side scripting, network security configuration, and more.<br>

Web development typically involves collaboration between various professionals, such as web designers, front-end developers, back-end developers, and database administrators. The process can vary depending on the specific requirements of the project, but it generally follows a series of steps from planning and design to development, testing, deployment, and ongoing maintenance.<br>

There are two main categories of web development:

Front-end development: This involves creating the visual and interactive parts of a website or web application that users interact with directly. It includes technologies like HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript, which are used to structure content, define styles, and add interactivity.

<p>Back-end development: This involves building the server-side logic and database management systems that power the website or web application. Back-end development languages and frameworks, such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Node.js, and .NET, are used to handle data processing, user authentication, server configuration, and more.<br></p>

<p>Overall, web development plays a crucial role in enabling businesses, organizations, and individuals to establish an online presence, interact with users, and deliver services or content over the internet.</p>
